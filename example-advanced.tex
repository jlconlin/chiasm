\section*{Replacement Nesting Example}

Notice how the nested chiasm ``replaces'' the D level:

\begin{chiasm}
  \item Level A
  \item Level B
  \item Level C
  % No \item here - the nested chiasm becomes D.a, D.b, etc.
  \begin{chiasm}
    \item Nested first (becomes D.a)
    \item Nested second (becomes D.b)
    \item Nested third (becomes D.c)
    \chiasmreturn
    \item Nested third returns
    \item Nested second returns
    \item Nested first returns
  \end{chiasm}
  % Notice: C' comes next, D' is skipped
  \chiasmreturn
  \item Level C returns
  \item Level B returns
  \item Level A returns
\end{chiasm}

\section*{Multiple Nested Levels}

A structure with multiple nesting levels:

\begin{chiasm}
  \item Top level A
  \item Top level B
    \begin{chiasm}
      \item Second level a (B.a)
      \item Second level b (B.b)
        \begin{chiasm}
          \item Third level i (B.b.i)
          \item Third level ii (B.b.ii)
          \chiasmreturn
          \item Third level ii returns
          \item Third level i returns
        \end{chiasm}
      \chiasmreturn
      \item Second level b returns
      \item Second level a returns
    \end{chiasm}
  \chiasmreturn
  \item Top level B returns
  \item Top level A returns
\end{chiasm}

\section*{Literary Example: Psalm-like Structure}

A chiastic structure common in Hebrew poetry:

\begin{chiasm}
  \item Blessed is the man
  \item who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
  \item nor stands in the way of sinners,
  \item nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
  \chiasmpivot
  \item but his delight is in the law of the LORD,
  \chiasmreturn
  \item and on his law he meditates day and night.
  \item He is like a tree planted by streams of water
  \item that yields its fruit in its season,
  \item and its leaf does not wither.
\end{chiasm}

\section*{Historical Narrative Example}

A chiastic structure in narrative form:

\begin{chiasm}
  \item The people gathered in the city
  \item The king proclaimed a new law
  \item The elders assembled to discuss
  \item The prophet spoke words of warning
    \begin{chiasm}
      \item ``Hear, O people,
      \item the word of the Lord:
      \item Turn from your wicked ways
      \chiasmreturn
      \item and return to righteousness
      \item before judgment comes
      \item upon this generation.''
    \end{chiasm}
  \chiasmreturn
  \item The people considered the prophet's words
  \item The elders debated late into the night
  \item The king issued a decree of repentance
  \item The people rejoiced and returned home
\end{chiasm}
